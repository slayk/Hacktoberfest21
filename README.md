**⚡ Little Description About The Game ⚡**

- Hangman is an old school favorite, a word game where the goal is simply to find the missing word or words. 
- You will be presented with a number of blank spaces representing the missing letters you need to find. 
- Use the keyboard to guess a letter (I recommend starting with vowels). 
- If your chosen letter exists in the answer, then all places in the answer where that letter appear will be revealed. 
- After you've revealed several letters, you may be able to guess what the answer is and fill in the remaining letters. 
- Be warned, every time you guess a letter wrong you loose a life and the hangman begins to appear, piece by piece.
